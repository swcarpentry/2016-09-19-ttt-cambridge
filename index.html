<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{ site.swc_site }}">Software Carpentry</a>
  and <a href="{{ site.dc_site }}">Data Carpentry</a>'s mission is to
  help scientists and engineers get more research done in less time
  and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for scientific
  computing.  This hands-on two-day workshop covers the basics of
  educational psychology and instructional design, and looks at how to
  use these ideas in both intensive workshops and regular classes.
</p>
<p>
  The workshop is a mix of lectures and hands-on lessons where you
  practice giving a short lesson using approaches learned and
  implement some of the teaching techniques which we will discuss.
  This is training for teaching, not technical training; you do not
  need any particular technical background, and we will not be
  teaching that. This workshop is based on the constantly revised and
  updated
 <a href="{{ site.training_site }}">curriculum</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong> The course is aimed at everyone who is
  interested in becoming a better teacher. In particular, this training
  is aimed at those who want to become Software and Data Carpentry
  instructors, run workshops and contribute to the Carpentry training
  materials.  You don't currently have to be an instructor or a
  teacher to attend this workshop, but you do need to be willing and
  committed to becoming one and to improving your teaching techniques.
</p>

<!--
  LOCATION

  This block displays the address and links to maps showing directions
  if the latitude and longitude of the workshop have been set.  You
  can use http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html to find the lat/long of an

{% endif %}

<p>
  <strong>Requirements:</strong> Participants should bring a laptop
  that is Internet connected and has a functioning browser.  If you
  have it, a device for recording audio and video (mobile phones and
  laptops are OK) is useful as throughout the two days, we are going
  to record one another teaching in pairs or threes.  It does not have
  to be high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can
  understand what someone is saying.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that after this course is over, you will be asked to do
  three short follow-up exercises online in order to finish qualifying
  as an instructor: the details are available at
  <a href="{{ site.training_site }}/checkout/">{{ site.training_site }}/checkout/</a>.
  If you have any questions about the workshop, the reading material,
  or anything else, please get in touch.

  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.
